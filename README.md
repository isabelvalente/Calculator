# Sparta-Calculator

## Purpose
This is a ruby command line calculator. It was built as a challenge to implement knowledge of ruby. The requirements for the app were as follows:


* Must have a basic and advanced mode.
* The basic mode must be able to add, multiply, divide and subtract any two numbers.
* The advanced mode must be able to have the squareroot and power function.

## Implementation
The funcitonality has been implemented using ruby.

## Usage

Alternatively the following command can be copied into the terminal:

```
git clone hub.com/isabelvalente/Sparta-Calculator.git
```
#### Customising
To customise the calculator modify the contents of the following files:

* app.rb

#### Running the calculator

To run, download, unzip and open the file. On the terminal type ``ruby app.rb`` and the calculator will initiate on the command line.

## Challenges
As I am new to ruby it was a challenge for me to keep the code DRY. I think there many have been a more effective control method as I used only if statements. I found myself stuck on the square root function. I did not know there was an in-built square root method so at fist I spent quite some time trying to reverse the power function as I knew that the square root is the opposite of power.
